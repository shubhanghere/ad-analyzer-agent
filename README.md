# Ad Performance Analysis Agent

## Project Overview

This is an AI-powered ad analysis tool that reads marketing performance data from a CSV file and generates a full report. The agent identifies key performance metrics like CTR and CPA, highlights the best and worst performing ads, and provides creative suggestions to improve your campaigns.

The project uses:
- **Python** for backend logic
- **LangChain** to manage agent behavior
- **Googleâ€™s Gemini Flash Model** for AI analysis
- **FastAPI** to serve the application through a web API

---

## How It Works

The agent follows a two-step analysis process:

### 1. Quantitative Analysis
It uses Pandas to read and analyze the uploaded CSV file. In this step, it calculates all the important KPIs like:
- Click-Through Rate (CTR)
- Cost Per Acquisition (CPA)
- Conversion Rate
- ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)

---


### 2. Qualitative Synthesis
The AI then interprets this data like a human strategist. It explains:
- Why certain ads worked well or failed
- What trends it noticed
- What improvements or new ideas you could try

---
